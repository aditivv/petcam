# Why Petcam?
Have you ever left your pet(s) at home for a day, only to spend the whole time worrying about their safety? Though most people may own security cameras, it can take minutes to actually locate your pet's location, which may be just enough time to miss spotting something that could have been prevented (whether it be a masked intruder taking off with your pet, or your pet simply getting into a bag of cookies you left on the counter). Even motion sensors can be misleading, as other factors could trigger the camera. With Petcam, you will be notified whenever your pet is located in view of the camera, eliminating any confusion and allowing pet owners to leave their pets at home knowing that they can more efficiently ensure their safety.
