# What is Petcam?
Many people own motion-sensor security cameras that allow them to know whether there are intruders at home or not. When the camera detects motion, people can check to make sure their homes are still safe. However, nowadays, most people with pets simply disregard these notifications, assuming that the motion is their pets running around at home. This is only natural, but also increases the chances of people missing an intruder in their very own home! 
Petcam is an AI model that determines whether objects in front of the camera are your pets or not. If there is an intruder (or foreign object) in front of your camera, then the camera will notify the user that the object in front of the camera is not your pet.

# How does it work?
Petcam uses the Jetson Imagenet network to classify whether the object in front of the camera is your pet or not.

# What you need to use Petcam:
1. A USB webcam
2. Python3 installed
3. A Jetson nano
